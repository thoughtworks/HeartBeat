# 1 About Heartbeat

Heartbeat is a tool for tracking project delivery metrics that can help you get a better understanding of delivery performance. This product allows you easily get all aspects of source data faster and more accurate to analyze team delivery performance which enables delivery teams and team leaders focusing on driving continuous improvement and enhancing team productivity and efficiency.

State of DevOps Report is launching in 2019. In this webinar, The 4 key metrics research team and Google Cloud share key metrics to measure DevOps performance, measure the effectiveness of development and delivery practices. They searching about six years, developed four metrics that provide a high-level systems view of software delivery and performance.

**Here are the four Key meterics:**

1.  Deployment Frequency (DF)
2.  Lead Time for changes (LTC)
3.  Mean Time To Recover (MTTR)
4.  Change Failure Rate (CFR)

In Heartbeat tool, we also have some other metrics, like: Velocity, Cycle Time and Classification. So we can collect DF, LTC, CFR, Velocity, Cycle Time and Classification.

For MTTR meter, specifically, if the pipeline stay in failed status during the selected period, the unfixed part will not be included for MTTR calculation.

# 2 Support tools

Here is the user manaul for Version 1 on 2020/06. For now, we just can support Jira/Buildkite/Github to generate the corresponding metrics data.
| Type | Board | Pipeline | Repo |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Support tools | Jira √ </br> Trello × | Buildkite √ </br>Teamcity × </br> GoCD × | Github √ </br> Bitbucket × |

**Note：** “√” means can support, “×” means can not support

# 3 Product Features

## 3.1 Config project info

### 3.1.1 Config Board/Pipeline/Source data

Before generator the metrics data, user need to config the project info, in Home page (Image3-1), you can create a new project for your project, or you can import a project config json file (If you already saved one config file, for import file feature will introduce in “Import and Export feature ”).

![Image 3-1](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/au-heartbeat/data-hosting@main/readme/1.png)\
_Image 3-1，home page_

#### 3.1.2 Config search data

If you are first use the product, you need to select “Create A New Project”，it will go to config page (Image 3-2)

![Image 3-2](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/au-heartbeat/data-hosting@main/readme/2.png)\
_Image 3-2，Project config page_

Users need to select a period of time, then all of the data that follows is based on that time period.

**Have two items of time period:**

1.  **Regular Calendar(Weekend Considered):** If you select this item, it means all data will exclude the weekend.
2.  **Calendar with Chinese Holiday:** If you select this item, it means all data will exclude the weekend and Chinese holiday. So if the time period you selected contains Chinese holiday, you need to select this item.

All need to select which data you want to get, for now, we support seven metrics data (Image 3-3). Those seven metrics are `Deployment Frequency (DF)`, `Lead Time for changes (LTC)`, `Mean Time To Recover (MTTR)`, `Change Failure Rate (CFR)`, and `Velocity`, `Cycle time`, `Classification`, where

- `Velocity` : includes how many story points and cards we have completed within selected time period.
- `Cycle time`: the time it take for each card start to do until move to done.
- `Classification`: provide different dimensions to view how much efforts team spent within selected time period.

![Image 3-3](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/au-heartbeat/data-hosting@main/readme/3.png)\
_Image 3-3，Metrics Data_

#### 3.1.3 Config project account

Because all metrics data from different tools that your projects use. Need to have the access to these tools then you can get the data. So after select time period and metrics data, then you need to input the config for different tools(Image 3-4).

According to your selected required data, you need to input account settings for the respective data source. Below is the mapping between your selected data to data source.

**Crew Settings:** You could select your team members from a list get from board source. The list will include the assignees for those tickets that finished in the time period selected in the last step.

**Cycle Time:** It will list all columns for the current active jira board. Then users need to map the each column to the supported columns. Like, if your board have “in progress” column, it means developer doing this ticket, so it should be mapping with “In Dev” for the list we provide.

| Status              | Description                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| To do               | It means the ticket needs to be done, waiting for Dev to pick it. Cycle time doesn't include this time.                                |

1. user need to go to the jira board and click one card , then open dev tool switch to network part. 
2. then click card's history part. 
3. at that time, user can see one api call which headers request URL is https://xxx.atlassian.net/rest/gira/1/ . 
4. then go to review part, find fieldDisplayName which show Flagged and story point estimate and get the fieldId as the custom-field that user need to input in advanced settings. from image 3-11 and 3-12 we can find that  flagged custom field is customfield_10021, story points custom field is customfield_10016. 

#### 3.2.4 Pipeline configuration

![Image 3-13](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/au-heartbeat/data-hosting@main/readme/7.png)\
_Image 3-13，Settings for Pipeline_

They are sharing the similar settings which you need to specify the pipeline step so that Heartbeat will know in which pipeline and step, team consider it as deploy to PROD. So that we could use it to calculate metrics.

| Items         | Description                                       |

## 3.3 Export and import config info

### 3.3.1 Export Config Json File

When user first use this tool, need to create a project, and do some config. To avoid the user entering configuration information repeatedly every time, we provide a “Save” button in the config and metrics pages. In config page, click the save button, it will save all items in config page in a Json file. If you click the save button in the metrics page, it will save all items in config and metrics settings in a Json file. Here is the json file (Image 3-8)。Note: Below screenshot just contains a part of data.

![Image 3-14](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/995849/89784710-b4c41180-db4b-11ea-9bc4-db14ce98ef69.png)\
_Image 3-14, Config Json file_

### 3.3.2 Import Config Json File

When user already saved config file before, then you don’t need to create a new project. In the home page, can click Import Project from File button(Image 3-1) to select the config file. If your config file is too old, and the tool already have some new feature change, then if you import the config file, it will get some warning info(Image 3-9). You need to re-select some info, then go to the next page.

![Image 3-15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/995849/89784267-f902e200-db4a-11ea-9d0b-a8ab29a8819e.png)\

## 3.6 Caching data

In HeartBeat tool design, we have a cache setting for verify jira & pipeLine & gitHub config function and pipleLine loading function and generate report function.

- `For Jira/Buildkite/Github data`: TTL for cache -> 90 seconds
- `For holiday data`:TTL for cache -> 5 minutes

# 4 Known issues

## 4.1  Change status name in Jira board setting when there are cards in this status
As an administrator of the jira board, if you modify the workflow to change the status name, it will affect the calculation of duration for cards in that status. Considering the potential loss of duration, changing the status name can lead to loss of precision in cycle time calculation for related cards.

# 7 How to use

## 7.1 Docker-compose

First, create a `docker-compose.yml` file, and copy below code into the file.

```yaml
version: "3.4"

services:
  backend:
    image: ghcr.io/au-heartbeat/heartbeat_backend:latest
    container_name: backend
    ports:
      - 4322:4322
    restart: always
  frontend:
    image: ghcr.io/au-heartbeat/heartbeat_frontend:latest
    container_name: frontend
    ports:
      - 4321:80
    depends_on:
      - backend
    restart: always
```

Then, execute this command

```sh
docker-compose up -d frontend
```
