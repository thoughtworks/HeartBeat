# 1 About Heartbeat

Heartbeat is a tool for tracking project delivery metrics that can help you get a better understanding of delivery performance. This product allows you easily get all aspects of source data faster and more accurate to analyze team delivery performance which enables delivery teams and team leaders focusing on driving continuous improvement and enhancing team productivity and efficiency.

State of DevOps Report is launching in 2019. In this webinar, The 4 key metrics research team and Google Cloud share key metrics to measure DevOps performance, measure the effectiveness of development and delivery practices. They searching about six years, developed four metrics that provide a high-level systems view of software delivery and performance. Based on that, Heartbeat introduce below metrics as below.

**8 metrics supported by heartbeat:**


1.  [Velocity](#341-velocity)
2.  [Cycle time](#341-velocity)
3.  [Classification](#343-classification)
4.  [Rework](#344-rework)
5.  [Deployment Frequency](#345-deployment-frequency) 
6.  [Lead Time for changes](#346-lead-time-for-changes-data)
7.  [Dev Change Failure Rate](#347-dev-change-failure-rate)
8.  [Dev Mean Time To Recovery](#348-dev-mean-time-to-recovery)


# 2 Support tools

Here is the user manaul for Version 1 on 2020/06. For now, we just can support Jira/Buildkite/Github to generate the corresponding metrics data.
| Type | Board | Pipeline | Repo |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Support tools | Jira √ </br> Trello × | Buildkite √ </br>Teamcity × </br> GoCD × | Github √ </br> Bitbucket × |

**Note：** “√” means can support, “×” means can not support

# 3 Product Features

## 3.1 Config project info

### 3.1.1 Config Board/Pipeline/Source data

Before generator the metrics data, user need to config the project info, in Home page (Image3-1), you can create a new project for your project, or you can import a project config json file (If you already saved one config file, for import file feature will introduce in “Import and Export feature ”).

![Image 3-1](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/au-heartbeat/data-hosting@main/readme/1.png)\
_Image 3-1，home page_

#### 3.1.2 Config search data

If you are first use the product, you need to select “Create A New Project”，it will go to config page (Image 3-2)

![Image 3-2](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/au-heartbeat/data-hosting@main/readme/2.png)\
_Image 3-2，Project config page_

Users need to select a period of time, then all of the data that follows is based on that time period.

**Have two items of time period:**

1.  **Regular Calendar(Weekend Considered):** If you select this item, it means all data will exclude the weekend.
2.  **Calendar with Chinese Holiday:** If you select this item, it means all data will exclude the weekend and Chinese holiday. So if the time period you selected contains Chinese holiday, you need to select this item.

All need to select which data you want to get, for now, we support seven metrics data (Image 3-3). Those seven metrics are `Deployment Frequency (DF)`, `Lead Time for changes (LTC)`, `Mean Time To Recover (MTTR)`, `Change Failure Rate (CFR)`, and `Velocity`, `Cycle time`, `Classification`, where

- `Velocity` : includes how many story points and cards we have completed within selected time period.
- `Cycle time`: the time it take for each card start to do until move to done.
- `Classification`: provide different dimensions to view how much efforts team spent within selected time period.

![Image 3-3](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/au-heartbeat/data-hosting@main/readme/3.png)\
_Image 3-3，Metrics Data_

##### 3.1.2.1 Date picker validation rules

User can not select future time in calendar (both start time & end time). The max date interval between start time and end time is 31 days (e.g. 01/01/2024 - 01/31/2024).

Invalid dates may be, e.g. future dates, interval between start time and end time is more than 31 days, end time is before start time, etc.

If user selects and invalid date, a warning may be shown.

#### 3.1.3 Config project account

Because all metrics data from different tools that your projects use. Need to have the access to these tools then you can get the data. So after select time period and metrics data, then you need to input the config for different tools(Image 3-4).

According to your selected required data, you need to input account settings for the respective data source. Below is the mapping between your selected data to data source.

| Required Data             | Datasource     |
|---------------------------| -------------- |
| Velocity                  | Board          |

1. user need to go to the jira board and click one card , then open dev tool switch to network part. 
2. then click card's history part. 
3. at that time, user can see one api call which headers request URL is https://xxx.atlassian.net/rest/gira/1/ . 
4. then go to review part, find fieldDisplayName which show Flagged and story point estimate and get the fieldId as the custom-field that user need to input in advanced settings. from image 3-13 and 3-14 we can find that  flagged custom field is customfield_10021, story points custom field is customfield_10016. 

#### 3.2.5 Pipeline configuration

![Image 3-19](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/au-heartbeat/data-hosting@main/readme/7.png)\
_Image 3-19，Settings for Pipeline_

They are sharing the similar settings which you need to specify the pipeline step so that Heartbeat will know in which pipeline and step, team consider it as deploy to PROD. So that we could use it to calculate metrics.

| Items         | Description                                       |
| ------------- --|----------------------------------------------------------------- |

| Steps         | The pipeline step that consider as deploy to PROD || Branches      | Your selected branches                            |

## 3.3 Export and import config info

### 3.3.1 Export Config Json File

When user first use this tool, need to create a project, and do some config. To avoid the user entering configuration information repeatedly every time, we provide a “Save” button in the config and metrics pages. In config page, click the save button, it will save all items in config page in a Json file. If you click the save button in the metrics page, it will save all items in config and metrics settings in a Json file. Here is the json file (Image 3-16)。Note: Below screenshot just contains a part of data.

![Image 3-20](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/995849/89784710-b4c41180-db4b-11ea-9bc4-db14ce98ef69.png)\
_Image 3-20, Config Json file_

### 3.3.2 Import Config Json File

When user already saved config file before, then you don’t need to create a new project. In the home page, can click Import Project from File button(Image 3-1) to select the config file. If your config file is too old, and the tool already have some new feature change, then if you import the config file, it will get some warning info(Image 3-17). You need to re-select some info, then go to the next page.

![Image 3-21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/995849/89784267-f902e200-db4a-11ea-9d0b-a8ab29a8819e.png)\
_Image 3-21, Warning message_

## 3.4 Generate Metrics report

After setup and configuration, then it will generate the heartbeat dashboard.
![Image 3-22](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/au-heartbeat/data-hosting@main/readme/8.png)
_Image 3-22, Report page_

You could find the drill down from `show more >` link from dashboard.

### 3.4.1 Velocity

In Velocity Report, it will list the corresponding data by Story Point and the number of story tickets. (image 3-19)
- `Velocity` : includes how many story points and cards we have completed within selected time period.
- Definition for 'Velocity(Story Point)‘: how many story point we have completed within selected time period.
- Formula for 'Velocity(Story Point): sum of story points for done cards in selected time period
- Definition for 'Throughput(Cards Count): how many story cards we have completed within selected time period.

### 3.4.2 Cycle Time

The calculation process data and final result of Cycle Time are calculated by rounding method, and two digits are kept after the decimal point. Such as: 3.567... Is 3.56; 3.564... Is 3.56.
- `Cycle time`: the time it take for each card start ‘to do’ until move to ‘done’.
- Definition for ‘Average Cycle Time(Days/SP)’: how many days does it take on average to complete a point?
- Formula for ‘Average Cycle Time(Days/SP)’: sum of cycle time for done cards/done cards story points
- Definition for ‘Average Cycle Time(Days/Card)’: how many days does it take on average to complete a card?
- Formula for ‘Average Cycle Time(Days/Card)’: sum of cycle time for done cards/done cards count

### 3.4.3 Classification

It will show the classification data of Board based on your selection on `Classification Settings` in metrics page.
The percentage value represent the count of that type tickets vs total count of tickets.
- `Classification`: provide different dimensions to view how much efforts team spent within selected time period.
- for example: spike cards account for 17.65% of the total completed cards

### 3.4.4 Rework

- Definition for ‘Rework': cards roll back from a later state to a previous state, for example, one card move from 'testing' state to 'in dev' state, which means this card is reworked.
- Formula for 'Total rework times': the total number of rework times in all done cards
- Formula for 'Total rework cards': the total number of rework cards in all done cards
- Formula for 'Rework cards ratio': total rework cards/throughput

It will show the rework data of board on your selection on `Rework times settins` in metrics page (image 3-21).

If "to do" is selected in the "Rework to which column", we will count the number of times the subsequent options in the options are reworked back to the "to do" state.

### 3.4.6 Lead time for changes Data
- Formula for ‘PR lead time':
  - if PR exist : PR lead time = PR merged time - first code committed time
  - if no PR or revert PR: PR lead time = 0

- Formula for ‘Pipeline lead time':
  - if PR exist: Pipeline lead time = Job Complete Time - PR merged time
  - if no PR: Pipeline lead time = Job Complete Time - Job Start Time

### 3.4.7 Dev Change Failure Rate
- Definition for ‘Dev Change Failure Rate': this metrics is different from the official definition of change failure rate, in heartbeat, we definite this metrics based on development，which is the percentage of failed pipelines in the total pipelines, and you chan select different pipeline as your final step,and this value is lower means failed pipeline is fewer.
- Formula for ‘Dev Change Failure Rate': the number of build for (Status = failed)/the number of build for [（Status = passed & Valid = true）+ the number of build for (status=failed)]

### 3.4.8 Dev Mean time to recovery
- Definition for ‘Dev Mean time to recovery': this metrics is also different from the official definition of Mean time to recovery. This metrics comes from pipeline, and it records how long it generally takes to restore when pipeline failed, and If this value is less than 8 hours, it means ‘red does not last overnight’, which means our repair speed is relatively good.
- Formula for ‘Dev Mean time to recovery': sum[he time difference from the first fail to the first pass for deployment completed time]/ the number of repairs

## 3.6 Caching data

In HeartBeat tool design, we have a cache setting for verify jira & pipeLine & gitHub config function and pipleLine loading function and generate report function.

- `For Jira/Buildkite/Github data`: TTL for cache -> 90 seconds
- `For holiday data`:TTL for cache -> 5 minutes

# 4 Known issues

## 4.1  Change status name in Jira board setting when there are cards in this status
As an administrator of the jira board, if you modify the workflow to change the status name, it will affect the calculation of duration for cards in that status. Considering the potential loss of duration, changing the status name can lead to loss of precision in cycle time calculation for related cards.

# 5 Instructions

## 5.1 Prepare for Jira Project

For Classic Jira users, before you use this tool, you need to do some settings for the jira board. Otherwise, you cannot get the data. Here are the steps you need to do:

1.  Open https://{site}.atlassian.net/secure/admin/ViewIssueFields.jspa?start=0&searchFilter=
    ![Image 5-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/995849/89785230-a75b5700-db4c-11ea-9ce2-4ff7894bbf25.png)\
    _Image 5-1_

2.  You need to enable any items you want to know. In the above page, If you want to change any items' screens, you can click the screens link in the actions column for that item. Then in the next page, check the project you want to change, and update it. Like: Story points

- ![Image 5-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/995849/89785239-ab877480-db4c-11ea-9e82-952777936cf8.png)\
  _Image 5-2_

- ![Image 5-3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/995849/89785244-acb8a180-db4c-11ea-958f-663a7efa105c.png)\
  _Image 5-3_

For the next-gen Jira, when you add story points item, the name should be Story Points or Story point estimate.

We love your input! Please see our [contributing guide](contribution.md) to get started. Thank you 🙏 to all our contributors!

# 10 Pipeline Strategy

Now, Heartbeat uses `GitHub Actions` and `BuildKite` to build and deploy Heartbeat application. 

But there is some constrains, like some pipeline dependency. 

So, committer should pay attention to this flow when there is some pipeline issues. 

```mermaid
	sequenceDiagram
  actor Committer
  participant GitHub_Actions as GitHub Actions
  participant BuildKite

	Committer ->> GitHub_Actions : Push code
	Committer ->> BuildKite : Push code
  loop 30s/40 times
    BuildKite->> GitHub_Actions: Check the basic check(all check before 'deploy-infra' job) has been passed
    GitHub_Actions -->> BuildKite: Basic check has passed?
    alt Yes
      BuildKite ->> BuildKite: Build and deploy e2e env
      Note over BuildKite, GitHub_Actions: Some times passed
      loop 30s/60 times
        GitHub_Actions ->> BuildKite: Request to check if the e2e has been deployed
        BuildKite -->> GitHub_Actions: e2e deployment status, if the e2e has been deployed?
        alt Yes
          GitHub_Actions ->> GitHub_Actions: Run e2e check on GitHub actions
          Note over BuildKite, GitHub_Actions: Some times passed
          GitHub_Actions -->> Committer: Response the pipeline result to committer
          BuildKite -->> Committer: Response the pipeline result to committer
        else No
          GitHub_Actions -->> Committer: Break the pipeline 
        end
      end
    else No
      BuildKite -->> Committer: Break the pipeline
    end
  end
```
