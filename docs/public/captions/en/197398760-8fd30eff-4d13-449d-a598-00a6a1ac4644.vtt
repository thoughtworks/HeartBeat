Hey everyone, I’m Dan, and today I’m going to show you how to use Tailwind CSS with your Astro project.

00:06.815 --> 00:12.415
You can see I’ve got a basic Astro site here and it looks pretty boring, so I want to add some styles to it.

00:12.500 --> 00:15.500
I’ll click this button to open up a new terminal

00:15.511 --> 00:19.871
where I can run the command “npx astro add tailwind”.

00:20.107 --> 00:25.500
This command can be found in the integration docs which I will be sure to link.

00:26.327 --> 00:34.383
It prompts me to permit it to modify the configuration file to support Tailwind and go ahead and hit yes to that

00:34.563 --> 00:38.673
and now it wants to install Tailwind itself and I’ll definitely hit yes to that.

00:39.017 --> 00:44.760
Once that’s done it wants to generate a Tailwind configuration file automatically so I’ll hit yes

00:45.076 --> 00:49.365
and all I have to do now is restart the dev server

00:49.447 --> 00:55.857
and we can see I’ve got some great styles already written out in Tailwind in one of my components.

00:56.069 --> 01:02.075
Let me just make the header bold, using Tailwind.

01:02.236 --> 01:04.927
And there we have it: Tailwind in Astro!
