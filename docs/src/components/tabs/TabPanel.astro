	These styles avoid layout shift on page load.
	We don’t want to hide all tabs forever in case JS never loads,
	so instead we hide them initially with an animation that jumps
	from hidden to visible after 10s. Usually JS will run before
	10s at which point we’ll rely on the `hidden` attribute and
	toggle off the animation using `role='tabpanel'`. Both these
	attributes are injected by the JS.
