        "name": "Issue Type",
        "flag": false
      }
    ],
    "jiraColumns": [

      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  - users: Only consider the users who has been assigned to the done cards.

  - If there are no done cards within the selected date range, the response will be empty. And you will not be able to
    proceed to the next page.

> Result
>
> Unable to confirm which column the user wants to mark as done. So cannot filter out only the done card during verfiy,
> otherwise the Crew Setting will be incomplete.

## Metrics page

### Crews setting

- Only include users assigned to the done cards.

### Cycle time settings

- Now only support mark one column as done.

- If the limitation of **only supporting one column marked as done** is removed, the Real Done component will display
  the status of all columns that marked as done. Report request can be sent to generate a report successfully.

- Report request

  ```json
  {
    "token": "",
    "type": "jira",
    "site": "dorametrics",
    "projectKey": "ADM",
    "boardId": "2",
    "boardColumns": [
      {
        "name": "TODO",
        "value": "To do"
      },
      {
        "name": "Doing",
        "value": "In Dev"
      },
      {
        "name": "Blocked",
        "value": "Block"
      },
      {
        "name": "Review",
        "value": "Review"
      },
      {
        "name": "Testing",
        "value": "Done"
      },
      {
        "name": "Done",
        "value": "Done"
      }
    ],
    "treatFlagCardAsBlock": true,
    "users": ["Guoqing Li", "Xinyi Xing"],
    "targetFields": [
      {
        "key": "issuetype",
        "name": "Issue Type",
        "flag": true
      },
      {
        "key": "parent",
        "name": "Parent",
        "flag": true
      }
    ],
    "doneColumn": ["DONE", "TESTING"]
  }
  ```

### Real done

- Now, if multiple columns are marked as done, the component will be hidden and cannot go to the next page.

> NOTE
>
> If the response result of verify is empty, go directly to the Metrics page, the component rendering will fail.

# Backend

## Report page

### Velocity

- According to the `doneColumn` parameter in the request, will return cards marked as done. In `getAllDoneCards` method.
- When processing original cards, it is re-filtered, and only the cards whose status is done are filtered out.
  In `getMatchedCards()` method.
- `Throughput(Cards Count)` only include done cards whose latest history status is `done` or `closed`, whatever user
  mark which column as done.

### Cycle Time

```java
public class CycleTimeInfo {

    private String column;

    private Double day;

}
```

- First, calculate days of each column. When calculate `Average cycle time` and `Total cycle time`,
  remove `To do, Analysis, Done` column days.

### Card Cycle Time

- Mark other column as done, will not calculate this column days in board CSV.

- Mark testing column as testing, will calculate `Total testing time / Total cycle time` in board CSV. But mark testing column as done, will not calculate that in board CSV.

### Origin Cycle Time

- The calculation logic will not be affected by multi-done columns.

### Support deduplication of Done cards

- We need to exclude the cards with a status of `DONE` on the startDate at the very begining of our calculation.
- The way to achieve:
  - Use jira card history
