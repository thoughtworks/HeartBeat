description: Seeking Suitable Chart API Solution

### Summary

As our roadmap planed, Heartbeat application will show charts with the all metrics data.
So that, the user can compare the historical data with different sprint.

We need to choose a charting backend and frontend API refactor solution to implement the design.

### Context

According to the new business requirements and the roadmap, there are some points for charting API refactor.

* Support metrics page frontend transfer more date info and call backend API
* Support report page frontend transfer more date info and call backend API

### Options

- Metrics

As shown in the image, we want to refactor the frontend and backend solutions for metrics page. About `board info`, `pipelines info`,
`pipelines step` API, we can transfer date information merged into a list. When frontend call backend API, backend invoke relevant service 
to handle information, and input the response to frontend.

The response sent by the backend here will be in the form of a list, but not a combination.
 Because the data received by the metrics interface here will be sent as parameters to the backend in subsequent report interfaces.

- Report

As shown in the image, we want to refactor the frontend and backend solutions for report page. About `reports board`, `reports dora`,
`reports poll {reportId}` API, we can transfer date info time and time again. Due to the logic of the report page,
 we are unable to merge the date list and transfer it to the backend, which may result in errors that cannot be loaded separately.
 
Specific `reportId` need to be accompanied by additional identifiers in the responses sent,
 such as information related to the selected time, to distinguish time periods
