description: Seeking Suitable Chart Components for Heartbeat
---

### Summary

As our roadmap planed, Heartbeat application will show charts with the all metrics data.
So that, the user can compare the historical data with different sprint.

But now, there is no chart implementation in this project, and we need to choose a charting library to implement the design.

### Context

According to the new business requirements and the roadmap, there is a need to introduce a general-purpose chart library to support corresponding development needs. Based on business requirements, there are several requirements for charts:
* Responsive support
* Support for multiple y-axes and composite charts
* Support for customizing tooltips
* Support for filtering charts by clicking the legends

### Scope

Frontend

### Current Status

None chart tools

### Options

- [npm trend](https://npmtrends.com/@nivo/core-vs-Nivo-vs-apexcharts-vs-d3-vs-echarts-vs-recharts-vs-victory-core)
