# Spike -- Analyse the impact on exported board data and precise of metrics when we change columns and statuses name

## Context

Currently, our practice is using the card's status change history to calculate its duration in each status.This historical data is crucial for accurately measuring the time spent in each status.

## Scenarios

### 1. If we modify the workflow to change the column name, what is the impact on exported board data?

If we only change the board setting: column name, **there are no implications to export board data and calculation of the metrics.**

### 2. If we modify the workflow to change the status name, what is the impact on exported board data?

**If we modify our workflow to change the status name, the export board data and precision of metrics will be influenced.**
Here is an example that simply illustrate this situation:
We change the status name in our workflow and there are some cards in this status. As depicted in the picture below, we undergo a name change: `Gong to do` -> `Going to do next`.

This change is only regarding board setting, so any changes made to the status name will not be reflected in the history of the associated cards.

As depicted in the above image, the status name has been changed to `Going to do next`. But the history records of the related cards do not indicate this transition.

#### 2.1 Issues caused by this scenario

1. Status name has been changed but when we calculate time spent in this status, it will put this time to previous status name.

2. The accuracy of status duration will be compromised as a result, consequently impacting the calculation of days for mapping multiple statuses to states.
_Days in board data affected:_
- Analysis Days

- In Dev Days

- Waiting Days

- Testing Days

- Block Days

- Review Days

#### 2.2 Solution to solve this issue

1. Try to avoid change status name when there are cards in this status.

2. Refactor code using id of status to calculate the duration in each status.
