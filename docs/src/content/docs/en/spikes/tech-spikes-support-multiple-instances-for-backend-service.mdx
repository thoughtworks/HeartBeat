title: Split multiple instances support
description: Split multiple instances support
---

## Background

Currently, heartbeat backend does not support multiple instance which make it hard to scale up the instance when load increasing.

## Expect

Multi-instance deployment is achieved through two methods: Docker Compose and k8s, and files can be shared between different instances.

## Solutions

File sharing between containers is achieved by introducing Volume in Docker Compose and PVC in k8s.

### 1. Docker Compose deployment

- docker-compose.yaml

```yaml
version: "3.4"

services:
  backend:
    image: ghcr.io/au-heartbeat/heartbeat_backend:latest
    expose:
      - "4322"
    restart: always
    deploy:
      replicas: 3
    volumes:
      - file_volume:/app/output
  frontend:
    image: ghcr.io/au-heartbeat/heartbeat_frontend:latest
    container_name: frontend
    ports:
      - "4321:80"
    depends_on:
      - backend
    restart: always

volumes:
  file_volume:
```

Three backend containers are started here and the files are mounted to file_volume

### 2. Kubernetes deployment

#### 2.1 First step

Create a namespace if the user does not have one.

```shell
kubectl create namespace heartbeat
```

#### 2.2 Second step

implement k8s yaml

- k8s-persistent-volume.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 200Mi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  storageClassName: heartbeat
  hostPath:
    path: /data
```

The `spec.capacity.storage` can be adjusted to the appropriate size.

- k8s-persistent-volume-claim.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 200Mi
  storageClassName: heartbeat
```

The `spec.resources.requests.storage` can be adjusted to the appropriate size, but not larger than `spec.capacity.storage` in the k8s-persistent-volume.yaml.

- k8s-backend-deployment.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: backend
  labels:
    app: backend
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: backend
    spec:
      initContainers:
        - name: backend-init
          image: busybox
          securityContext:
            runAsUser: 0
          volumeMounts:
            - name: volumes
              mountPath: /app/output
          command: ["sh", "-c", "chown -R 999:999 /app/output"]
      containers:
        - name: backend
          image: ghcr.io/au-heartbeat/heartbeat_backend:latest
          volumeMounts:
            - name: volumes
              mountPath: /app/output
      volumes:
        - name: volumes
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: pvc
```

Three backend pods are started here and the files are mounted to volumes

- k8s-backend-service.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: backend
spec:
  selector:
    app: backend
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 4322
      targetPort: 4322
```

- k8s-frontend-deployment.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: frontend
          image: ghcr.io/au-heartbeat/heartbeat_frontend:latest
```

- k8s-frontend-service.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  selector:
    app: frontend
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 4321
      targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer
```

### 3. Code modification under multiple instances

#### 3.1 In generating report files

When generating files, use `./app/output/csv` instead of `./csv`

- Mainly exists in classes

```
CSVFileGenerator.java
CSVFileNameEnum.java
```

- Check point

In the case of a single instance, check whether the three report files provided for download can be correctly generated and downloaded under the target file.

#### 3.2 Refactor async handler

- AsyncExceptionHandler.java

  - Need to initialize a folder `./app/output/error`.
  - Modify the put method to generate an intermediate file, the content of the file is the corresponding outlier, and then atomize the file name.
  - The get method reads the target file and returns null if the file does not exist, otherwise it returns an exception object.
  - When deleting a file fails, check if the file still exists. If it does not exist, the deletion is successful.

- AsyncReportRequestHandler.java

  - Need to initialize two folder `./app/output/report` and `./app/output/metricsDataReady`.
  - Modify the put method as AsyncExceptionHandler.
  - Modify the get method reads the target file and returns null if the file does not exist, otherwise it returns target object.
  - When deleting a file fails, check if the file still exists. If it does not exist, the deletion is successful.

#### 3.3 Delete expire csv file

- DeleteExpireCSVScheduler.java

  - Change file from `./csv/` to `./app/output/csv`
  - When deleting a file fails, check if the file still exists. If it does not exist, the deletion is successful.

#### 3.4 Change README

Put docker-compose.yaml in `7.1.1 Customize story point field in Jira` in README
